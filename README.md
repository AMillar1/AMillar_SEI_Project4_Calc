# Art of Arithmetic

## What is this website?

Art of Arithmetic is a website that allows users to add a component of working memory to the functionality of a typical callculator. One part of the app mimics a typical handheld calculator, but the user also has access to a log of all previous inputs and operations. Additonally, a user can 'save' specific values in a table, so that frequently used/cumbersome values can input with ease. A user can also save any log of inputs for reference later.

---------------

The purpose of this application is to allow users to peform calculations with the aid of working memory data. The app will show them the history of their current calculation session, and allow them to store specific values if they are frequently used or cumbersome. Users can save or delete these values, and reference the log at any time. Users can also save any calculation log for future reference or reflection. 

## Next Steps:
- Clean up CSS styling
- Allow users to input via the keyboard/text area in the calculator
- Allow users to enter the calculator via a saved log, with the state reset to the state of that log
- Allow users to name variables/saved values that they create
- Solve several calculator bugs/edge cases.
